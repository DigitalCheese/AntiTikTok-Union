    <h1>Dangerous TikTok Challenges</h1>
    <p1>As you all know, TikTok has a lot of dangerous challenges. They all suck too as a result. Some examples are the the benadryl challenge and the devious licks done in 2021. They are all just so stupid. Why would anyone enjoy this? It doesn't seem fun. But hey, I guess people found enjoyment in that. Just amazing and it's a 10/10 experience (this is sarcasm of course).</p1>
    <br>
    <p2>Below, there are resources such as videos about why these challenges are dangerous and bad. Some are more complicated than others. The benadryl challenge doesn't need much explaining as its even kinda bad in the name. Something like Devious Lick, might need more info for people who haven't heard of it.</p2>
